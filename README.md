Sprout is a platform for developers to connect and grow together. Stay on top of what is fresh and trending in tech so that you can grow your business, or even just yourself.

Sprout allows developers to recommend and discuss new technologies as they emerge. Currently, users can submit libraries and APIs that they find useful and would recommend to other developers. As Sprout continues to grow, we will add functionality that allows users to submit additional criteria, such as quality of documentation and GitHub activity.

User submitted technologies are then added to the Sprout database and displayed in the appropriate table. We are currently implementing a voting system. Once complete, tables will update according to how users score the technologies.

Sprout also serves as a platforms for users to practice utilizing new technologies that they discover. The Projects page shows a list of activities users can work on in order to hone their skills and learn some new tricks. These projects are submitted by users and curated by Sprout admin in order to ensure they meet standards set to ensure a quality learning experience.

Sprout is a work in progress and is currently in its second phase of development. We are working on implementing quality user authentication that will allow for more intensive involvement with the site. Once this authentication is in place, we will begin creating user profiles, a comment/messaging system and incentives for continued learning and growing. 


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
